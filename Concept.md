The market beta $\beta_{i}$ of an asset $i$, observed on $t$ occasions, is defined by (and best obtained via) a linear regression of the rate of return $r_{i,t}$ of asset $i$ on the rate of return $r_{m,t}$ of the (typically value-weighted) stock-market index $m$

$$
r_{i,t} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{i} \cdot r_{m,t} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{t}$ is an unbiased error term whose squared error should be minimized. The coefficient $\alpha_{i}$ is often referred to as the alpha which indicates how an investment has performed after accounting for the risk it involved
